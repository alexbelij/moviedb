# What is MovieDB? 🎬

MovieDB is an app written in Swift exclusively for iOS devices. It provides a feed of popular movies tv shows and allows you to see a more specific details about each one!

## Why?

Mostly because I am learning iOS development and it seemed like a nice litte project to expand my knowledge and portfolio. I also wanted to make more *simplified* version of already wonderful app from IMDB.

## Current state

The app works, and my goal was reached. However, there is still **a lot** of room for improvements. Let's say that the app is currently in some kind of **alpha** version.

## Planned features 📍

I have a lot of new ideas and projects to do, however, I'll try to maintain it regularly and add new features here and then. Here are some:

📌 night mode,

📌 show list of episodes for TV shows,

📌 include movie trailers,

📌 improve layout,

📌 add settings screen,

📌 clean up code (not really a feature but anyway),

📌 and about 1000 more improvements that I currently have in my mind.

## Thanks to TMDB! 💚
